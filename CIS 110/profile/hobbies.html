  <h2 class="pb"><u>Paintball</u></h2>
  <img class="pb" src="../images/Paintball.JPG" alt="my gearset">
  <p class="about">For some people, getting shot by a paintball gun is quite painfull but for me, its not really that big of a deal. I love this adrenaline filled action sport. I have my own gearset for it based around an azoidin brand marker. Normally, I tyipically go paintballing around once every other month and Im also Im Lucky enough to be within 50 miles of about a dozen or so unique paintball Fields thus giving me variety in where I play. However it is likely that I will have to put this Hobby on hold unitl I go back home or until im out of school.</p>
  <h2><u>Mountain Biking</u></h2>

  <p class="about">A recent Hobby I have Picked Up after recieving a mountain bike last Christmas. Initially I didnt have many chances to ride then BOOM quarantine hit. Thus I finally got the chance to get started. And Lucky for me I started riding just in time for the opening of a new public access bike park in my hometown that I have been using to learn how to handle the exciting parts of mountain biking such as jumps/drops.</p>
  <h2><u>Video Games</u></h2>
  <img class="mc" src="../images/Minecraft.png" alt="minecraft">
  <p class="about">I played lots of video games before coming to UO, I may not play as much now, but that stll doesnt mean I dont keep up with the Industry. I switch between my Xbox back home and PC. Some games I typically play include: Minecraft, Halo, Destiny, Valorant, CSGO, War Thunder, and more!</p>
  <h2><u>Working Out</u></h2>
  <img class="gym" src="../images/gym.jpeg" alt="weights">
