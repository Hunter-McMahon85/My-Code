1. use the input function to ask the user for an input for day and year and assign these values to a variable
2. import the is_leap_year() function from lab 4 
3. check to see if the year is valid (year>0), if not it will output an error message
4. call the is_leap_year() function for the inputed year to get a boolean value & assign to variable
5. write a function to check if the day is valid, if not it will output an error message
6. if both the day and the year are valid, code will move on to a function to give the date,
7. write the code to determine what month of the year it is based on conditionals and day of year, this will be dependent on whether or not the year is a leap year.
8. with the month determined, code will then need to be written to do math figure out what day of the month it is. 
9. now that the day month and year have been determined, they must be put together as a string and printed back to the user
