    <h3>Reasons I am Taking CIS 111</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>I Intend to major in CIS though have practically now experience what so ever with coding or programing and thus I was directed by my academic advisor down the 110, 111, 122 path to begin.</li>
        <li>Like I said earlier, I have no programming experience and would like to change that so thus I am taking the course to essentially learn my first programming language</li>
    </ol>
