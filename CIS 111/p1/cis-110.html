<p>introduced: 1974 retired 2006 <br>The F-14 Tomcat is a legend of a carrier based Aircraft and even a pop culture icon with it being featured heavily in the movies <em>Top Gun</em> and <em>The Final Countdown</em> Ultimately the US navy would replace it with the F/A 18 Hornet due to it being a cheaper aircraft that could do the same job (and it didnt require a Rio). However thats not to say that the Tomcat was a chump with a top speed of mach 2.1 compared to the hornets mach 1.5. Additionally the Tomcat could be equiped with a wide arsenel of Missiles and bombs including AIM-54 Pheonix Missiles which, with the tomcats weapons system allowed it to engage Bogeys at a range of up to 100 nautical miles.</p>
