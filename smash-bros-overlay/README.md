I made this simple overlay for my roomate who is a tournament organizer for the game. 
This code requires an visual studio code extension that lets you open the HTML files as a live server
using your device. I seek to improve this so it is not reliant on the localy hosted server when i get a break from classes.
Though for now, it does the job with the controller page being dockable in OBS thus creating an integrated experience.

Scoreboard is programed with JS and code can be found in the js_and_controller file
